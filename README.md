# IDS721 Final Project

## Introduction
This is the final project for the course IDS721, it is an image recognition web application built using Flask, Python, and TensorFlow. Users can upload an image, and the application will return the original image along with labels describing the content of the image. I used the Docker image to deploy this application and created a repository in DockerHub so that everyone could run it easily without cloning the whole project. Also, I depolyed this app on the AWS App Runner.

## Features

* Simple and clean user interface
* Upload images in various formats (jpg, jpeg, png, gif)
* Utilizes MobileNetV2 model for image recognition
* Displays top 5 predicted labels with probabilities
